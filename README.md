# spotify
Application where people can see their top 5 listened songs and artists on Spotify. They also can see their history of songs played. An user has to follow the link to the Spotify
website, copy the token and paste it in the field. When clicking the submit button, the tables will update and data from 10 days back is displayed. If data already exists in the
table it will not be duplicated. Data will be added to the existing table, so over time you have a table with all the songs you listened to on Spotify.  

This application is written in Flask with a SQLite database.
